            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.</p>

          <header>What is CSS for</header>
            <p>CSS can be used for:</p>
             <ul> 
                <li>Very basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of headings and links.</li> 
                <li>It can be used to create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information.</li> 
                <li>It can even be used for effects such as animation. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific examples.</li>
            </ul>
      </section>
      
      
      <section id="CSS_Syntax" class="main-section">
          <header>CSS Syntax</header>
            <p>CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as large red text."</p>

            <p>The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:</p>
          <div class="code-style">
                
 <code>h1 {
     color: red;
     font-size: 5em;
    }</code>
            </div>
            <p>The rule opens with a selector. This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case we are styling level one headings (h1).</p>

            <p>We then have a set of curly braces { }. Inside those will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting, then a value that we'd like to give the property.</p>

            <p>Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the value. CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. In our example, we have the color property, which can take various color values. We also have the font-size property. This property can take various size units as a value.</p>

            <p>A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.</p>
<div class="code-style">
                
 <code>h1 {
     color: red; 
     font-size: 5em;
    }
           
 p { 
    color: black;
   }</code>
        </div> 
      </section>
      
      
      <section id="Adding_CSS" class="main-section">
          <header>Adding CSS</header>
            <p>The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of your document.</p>

            <p>Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as styles.css. The .css extension shows that this is a CSS file.</p>

            <p>To link styles.css to index.html add the following line somewhere inside the &lt;head&gt; of the HTML document:</p>
            <div class="code-style">
 <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;</code>
        </div>
            <p>This &lt;link&gt; element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, using the rel attribute, and the location of that stylesheet as the value of the href attribute. You can test that the CSS works by adding a rule to styles.css. Using your code editor add the following to your CSS file:</p>
            <div class="code-style">
                    
 <code>h1 {
     color: red;
    }</code>
        </div>  
            <p>Save your HTML and CSS files and reload the page in a web browser. The level one heading at the top of the document should now be red. If that happens, congratulations — you have successfully applied some CSS to an HTML document. If that doesn't happen, carefully check that you've typed everything correctly.</p>
      </section>
      
      
      <section id="Styling_HTML_elements" class="main-section">
          <header>Styling HTML elements</header>
            <p>By making our heading red we have already demonstrated that we can target and style an HTML element. We do this by targeting an element selector — this is a selector that directly matches an HTML element name. To target all paragraphs in the document you would use the selector p. To turn all paragraphs green you would use:</p>
              <div class="code-style">
                
 <code>p {
    color: green;
   }</code>
        </div>
            <p>You can target multiple selectors at once, by separating the selectors with a comma. If I want all paragraphs and all list items to be green my rule looks like this:</p>
          <div class="code-style">
                
 <code>p, li {
        color: green;
       }</code>
        </div>
      </section>
      
      
      <section id="Adding_a_class" class="main-section">
          <header>Adding a class</header>
            <p>So far we have styled elements based on their HTML element names. This works as long as you want all of the elements of that type in your document to look the same. Most of the time that isn't the case and so you will need to find a way to select a subset of the elements without changing the others. The most common way to do this is to add a class to your HTML element and target that class.</p>

            <p>In your HTML document, add a class attribute to the second list item. Your list will now look like this:</p>

        <div class="code-style">
                    
 <code>&lt;ul&gt;
       &lt;li&gt;Item one&lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;li class="special"&gt;Item two&lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;li&gt;Item &lt;em>three&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
                    </code>
        </div>
            <p>In your CSS you can target the class of special by creating a selector that starts with a full stop character.</p> 
            <div class="code-style">
                    
 <code>.special {
          color: orange;
          font-weight: bold;
          } </code>
        </div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Item one</li>
                        <li class="special">Item two</li>
                        <li>Item <em>three</em></li>
                    </ul>

            <p>You can apply the class of special to any element on your page that you want to have the same look as this list item. For example, you might want the &lt;span&gt; in the paragraph to also be orange and bold. Try adding a class of special to it, then reload your page and see what happens.</p>
